What i did
gathered information about aerodynamic derivatives
mounted pixhawk to gimbal
enabled pixhawk imu and estimator
desgined control loop 
looked into hardware (how to plug in servos?)

Questions:
Where can i get time constants for servo/sensors?
Thomas's simulation is very sophisticated
Did i design control loop well?
How do i estimate states? what states can i estimate?
Do out servos have encoders?



check differences between delta coefficients
State estimation
